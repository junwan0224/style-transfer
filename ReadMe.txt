In this folder, you will find 

1. a pdf file which is the report.

2. an image folder which contains some of the images we think might help to evaluate our work. Every image is named as "the method used to generate this image"-"a number or a phrase that describe the image". For example, "split-and-match-splitted.jpg" is the image we achieved after applying the split algorithm on the "split-and-match-origin.jpg" image. 

3. a code folder which contains all of our source code. The code folder further contains three sub-folder which is named based on the implementation algorithm. Please see the corresponding folders on how to setup and run the codes.
